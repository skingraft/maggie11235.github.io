I am the <a href="https://philosophy.sas.ac.uk/jacobsen-fund">Jacobsen Fellow</a> based at both the <a href="https://philosophy.sas.ac.uk/">Institute of Philosophy</a> at the University of London and the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy/">Department of Philosophy</a> at University College London. I am also a Research Associate at the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/CPNSS">Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science</a> at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Most of my research has concerned scientific modelling: how do we use models to represent and explain natural and social phenomena? I think that to address these questions it's worth listening to what other philosophers have to say about linguistic or pictorial representation. But I also believe that the question won't be answered fully unless we investigate how scientists use models in practice. I'm currently thinking about the broader implications of the idea that all of the representations - from science, art, and the humanities - we use to situate ourselves in the world are partial and imprecise.
I wrote an easy introduction to these sorts of issues for the <a href="https://iainews.iai.tv/articles/modelling-life-in-art-and-science-auid-1185">Institute of Arts and Ideas</a>.

This monograph offers a critical introduction to current theories of how scientific models represent their target systems. Representation is important because it allows scientists to study a model to discover features of reality. The authors provide a map of the conceptual landscape surrounding the issue of scientific representation, arguing that it consists of multiple intertwined problems. They provide an encyclopaedic overview of existing attempts to answer these questions, and they assess their strengths and weaknesses. The book also presents a comprehensive statement of their alternative proposal, the DEKI account of representation, which they have developed over the last few years. They show how the account works in the case of material as well as non-material models; how it accommodates the use of mathematics in scientific modelling; and how it sheds light on the relation between representation in science and art. The issue of representation has generated a sizeable literature, which has been growing fast in particular over the last decade. This makes it hard for novices to get a handle on the topic because so far there is no book-length introduction that would guide them through the discussion. Likewise, researchers may require a comprehensive review that they can refer to for critical evaluations. This book meets the needs of both groups.

   <div class="hidden-box"> <p> I argue that fictional models, construed as models that misrepresent certain ontological aspects of their target systems, can nevertheless explain why the latter exhibit certain behaviour. They can do this by accurately representing whatever it is that that behaviour counterfactually depends on. However, we should be sufficiently sensitive to different explanatory questions, i.e., `why does certain behaviour occur?' vs. `why does the counterfactual dependency invoked to answer that question actually hold?'. With this distinction in mind, I argue that whilst fictional models can answer the first sort of question, they do so in an unmysterious way (contra to what one might initially think about such models). Moreover, I claim that the second question poses a dilemma for the defender of the idea that fictions can explain: either these models cannot answer these sorts of explanatory questions, precisely because they are fictional; or they can, but in a way that requires reinterpreting them such that they end up accurately representing the ontological basis of the counterfactual dependency, i.e., reinterpreting them so as to rob them of their fictional status. Thus, the existence of explanatory fictions does not put pressure on the idea that accurate representation of some aspect of a target system is a necessary condition on explaining that aspect.</p>

   <div class="hidden-box"> <p> How does mathematics apply to something non-mathematical? We distinguish between a <i>general application problem</i> and a <i>special application problem</i>. A critical examination of the answer that structural mapping accounts offer to the former problem leads us to identify a lacuna in these accounts: they have to presuppose that target systems are structured and yet leave this presupposition unexplained. We propose to fill this gap with an account that attributes structures to targets through <i>structure generating descriptions</i>. These descriptions are <i>physical</i> descriptions and so there is no such thing as a solely mathematical account of a target system.    </p>

   <div class="hidden-box"> <p>Veritism, the position that truth, or accuracy, is necessary for epistemic acceptability, seems to be in tension with the observation that much of our best science is not, strictly speaking, true when interpreted literally. This generates a paradox: (i) truth is necessary for epistemic acceptability; (ii) the claims of science have to be taken literally; (iii) much of what science produces is not literally true and yet it is acceptable. We frame Elgin’s project in <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/true-enough"><i>True Enough</i></a> as being motivated by, and offering a particular resolution to, this paradox. We discuss the paradox with a particular focus on scientific models and argue that there is another resolution available which is compatible with retaining veritism: rejecting the idea that scientific models should be interpreted literally.</p>

   <div class="hidden-box"> <p> The fragmentation of academic disciplines forces individuals to specialise. In doing so, they become experts over their narrow area of research. However, ambitious scientific projects, such as the search for gravitational waves, require them to come together and collaborate across disciplinary borders. How should scientists with expertise in different disciplines treat each others' expert claims? An intuitive answer is that the collaboration should defer to the opinions of experts. In this paper we show that under certain seemingly innocuous assumptions, this intuitive answer gives rise to an impossibility result when it comes to aggregating the beliefs of experts to deliver the beliefs of a collaboration as a whole. We then argue that when experts' beliefs come into conflict, they should waive their expert status.</p>

   <div class="hidden-box"> <p>In a series of recent papers we have developed an account of scientific representation according to which models should be viewed as fictions that represent their targets via keys. These keys provide a systematic way to move from model-features to features to be imputed to their targets. To the extent that these features are present in the latter, the representation is accurate. These keys are implicitly associated with modelling frameworks. Accordingly, to understand these frameworks we must understand the keys that accompany them. Here we analyse a key that that is crucial in many parts of physics, namely what we call the <i>limit key</i>. This key exploits the fact that the features exemplified by physical  models are limits of the features of the target. We demonstrate how these keys allow for accurate representation in the presence of idealisation, and further illustrate how investigating them provides novel ways of approaching certain currently debated questions in the philosophy of science. </p>

   <div class="hidden-box"> <p> Drawing on `interpretational' accounts of scientific representation, I argue that the use of so-called `toy models' provides no particular philosophical puzzle. More specifically; I argue that once one gives up the idea that models are accurate representations of their targets only if they are appropriately similar, then simple and highly idealized models can be accurate in the same way that more complex models can be. Their differences turn on trading precision for generality, but, if they are appropriately interpreted, toy models should nevertheless be considered accurate representations. A corollary of my discussion is a novel way of thinking about idealization more generally: idealized models may distort features of their targets, but they needn’t misrepresent them.</p>

In this paper, we employ category-theoretic tools to illuminate an aspect of this puzzle. We precisify what is meant by `surplus' structure by means of functorial comparisons with equivalence classes of gauge fields, and then show that such structure is essential for any theory that represents a rich collection of physically relevant fields which are `local' in nature.</p>

If Okasha is right, then there is no function (satisfying certain desirable conditions) from `preference' rankings supplied by scientific virtues over competing theories (or models, or hypotheses) to a single all-things-considered ranking. 
This threatens the rationality of science.

   <div class="hidden-box"> <p> Many scientific models are representations. Building on Goodman and Elgin's notion of representation-as we analyse what this claim involves by providing a general definition of what makes something a scientific model, and formulating a novel account of how they represent. We call the result the DEKI account of representation, which offers a complex kind of representation involving an interplay of, denotation, exemplification, keying up of properties, and imputation. Throughout we focus on material models, and we illustrate our claims with the Phillips-Newlyn machine. In the conclusion we suggest that, mutatis mutandis, the DEKI account can be carried over to other kinds of models, notably fictional and mathematical models.

<h2>Short Bio</h2>

I was previously a Postdoctoral Researcher in <a href="http://reilly.nd.edu/">History and Philosophy of Science</a> at the University of Notre Dame. I was awarded my PhD from the <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/">Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method</a> at the LSE in April 2016. Before joining the PhD programme, I obtained a BA in Philosophy from the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/"> University of Cambridge </a> (2010) and an MA in Philosophy from <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx">King's College London</a> (2011). My philosophical interests are broad and include: the philosophy of economics, physics, and science in general; aesthetics; formal epistemology and decision theory; and philosophical methodology.
